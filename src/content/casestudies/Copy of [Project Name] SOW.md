# Jitsi Installation, Set-Up and Rebranding

## The Challenge

The client required the installation, setup, and complete rebranding of Jitsi Meet, an open-source video conferencing solution.  Specific needs included:

* Full setup of the Jitsi server on their AWS account.
* Custom branding to reflect their organizational identity (logo, colors, domain).


## The Approach

Our solution involved a multi-stage process:

1. **Jitsi Installation & Setup:** We installed and configured a Jitsi Meet server on the client's AWS infrastructure, prioritizing performance and security. This included optimizing server settings for their specific needs.

2. **Jitsi Rebranding:**  We customized the Jitsi platform with the client's branding. This encompassed incorporating their logo, color scheme, and domain name to create a consistent user experience.  We required the following from the client to begin this phase:
    * Domain name
    * Domain mapping
    * Static IP Address
    * AWS account access
    * Logo and Favicon in SVG format


## The Outcome

The project was completed within 7 business days of receiving all necessary client information.  We successfully deployed a fully functional, branded Jitsi Meet instance on the client's AWS infrastructure, meeting all their requirements. The result is a customized video conferencing solution reflecting the client's brand identity, providing a seamless and professional user experience.


**Scope Boundaries (Out of Scope):**

The following were explicitly excluded from this project:

* Ongoing maintenance and updates post-completion.
* Custom feature development beyond standard Jitsi functionality.
* Support for network infrastructure not provided by the client.
* User training or onboarding sessions.
