# Jitsi Installation, Set-Up, and Rebranding

## The Challenge

[Client Name] required a robust and customizable video conferencing solution. They needed a platform that could be seamlessly integrated into their existing infrastructure (AWS) and fully reflect their brand identity.  The existing solution did not meet their needs for branding and customization.

## The Approach

Our team proposed a solution centered around Jitsi Meet, an open-source video conferencing platform.  Our approach included:

* **Jitsi Server Setup and Installation:** We installed and configured a Jitsi Meet server on the client's AWS account, ensuring optimal performance and security.  This involved setting up the necessary infrastructure and configuring the server according to their specific requirements.
* **Complete Rebranding:** We customized the Jitsi platform to match the client's branding. This encompassed incorporating their logo, colors, and domain name, creating a cohesive user experience that reinforced their brand identity.  This included using SVG logos and favicons for optimal display quality.
* **Configuration:**  We tailored settings to meet the organization's specific needs and requirements.

**Information Required:** To begin the project, we required the following from the client:

* Domain name
* Domain mapping
* Static IP Address
* AWS account access
* Logo and favicon in SVG format

**Out of Scope:** The following were explicitly excluded from the project scope:

* Ongoing maintenance and updates.
* Custom feature development beyond standard Jitsi functionality.
* Support for network infrastructure not provided by the client.
* User training or onboarding sessions.


## The Outcome

The project was completed within 7 business days of receiving the necessary client information.  We successfully deployed a fully functional and branded Jitsi Meet server on the client's AWS infrastructure. The result was a video conferencing solution that met the client's needs for both functionality and brand consistency.  The client now has a customized and professional video conferencing platform that reflects their brand identity.
