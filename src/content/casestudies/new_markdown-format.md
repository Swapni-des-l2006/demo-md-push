# Jitsi Installation, Setup, and Rebranding

## The Challenge

The client required the installation, setup, and complete rebranding of Jitsi Meet, an open-source video conferencing solution.  Their needs included:

* Full setup of the Jitsi server on their existing AWS account.
* Custom branding to reflect their organizational identity, including logo, colors, and domain.


## The Approach

Our approach involved a three-stage process:

1. **Jitsi Installation & Setup:**  We deployed and configured a Jitsi Meet server on the client's AWS infrastructure, prioritizing optimal performance and security.  This included meticulous configuration tailored to the client's specific needs and requirements.

2. **Jitsi Rebranding:** We completely customized the Jitsi user interface to align with the client's branding guidelines.  This ensured a consistent and cohesive user experience, reflecting their organizational identity throughout the platform.  We utilized provided SVG logos and favicons for seamless integration.

3. **Information Gathering:** Prior to starting, we collaborated closely with the client to gather the necessary information: domain name, domain mapping, static IP address, AWS account access credentials, and branding assets (logo and favicon in SVG format).

## The Outcome

The project was successfully completed within 7 business days of receiving all necessary information. The client now has a fully functional, branded Jitsi Meet instance hosted on their AWS account, providing a customized and secure video conferencing solution for their organization.  The solution seamlessly integrates with their existing infrastructure and branding, resulting in a positive and efficient user experience.

**Out of Scope:**  The following were explicitly excluded from the project scope:

* Ongoing maintenance and updates.
* Custom feature development beyond standard Jitsi functionality.
* Support for client-unprovided network infrastructure.
* User training or onboarding sessions.
