# Jitsi Installation, Setup, and Rebranding

## The Challenge

[Client Name] required a fully functional and branded video conferencing solution.  Their existing system was inadequate, and they sought a robust, open-source alternative that could be customized to reflect their corporate identity.  Key requirements included:

*   Full setup of a Jitsi Meet server on their AWS account.
*   Custom branding incorporating their logo, colors, and domain.


## The Approach

Our team proposed a comprehensive solution encompassing:

1.  **Jitsi Installation & Setup:** We deployed and configured a Jitsi Meet server on the client's AWS infrastructure, prioritizing performance and security. This involved careful server configuration to meet the client's specific needs.

2.  **Jitsi Rebranding:**  We completely customized the Jitsi platform's user interface to align perfectly with the client's branding. This included integrating their logo, implementing their color scheme, and ensuring their domain name was correctly mapped.  We used SVG format logos and favicons for optimal quality.

To initiate the process, we requested the following information from the client:

*   Domain name
*   Domain mapping details
*   Static IP address
*   AWS account access credentials
*   Logo and favicon in SVG format

**Out of Scope:**  The following were explicitly excluded from this project:

*   Ongoing maintenance and updates.
*   Custom Jitsi feature development beyond standard functionality.
*   Support for client-unprovided network infrastructure.
*   User training or onboarding.


## The Outcome

The project was successfully completed within 7 business days of receiving all necessary client information.  We delivered a fully functional, branded Jitsi video conferencing system deployed on the client's AWS account.  The system seamlessly integrated with their existing infrastructure and provided a user experience reflecting their brand identity.  The client was satisfied with the speed and quality of the implementation.
